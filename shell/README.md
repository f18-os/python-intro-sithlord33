## Shell Lab

Created a very basic shell using python3. The shell runs basic commands like
read and write to file, cat a file, and change directories. My shell stops
working when pressing enter without any arguments.

I struggled a lot with this shell. I asked Ricardo Alvarez, and Eduardo Lara
for help with my shell. I was able to finish thanks to them.
