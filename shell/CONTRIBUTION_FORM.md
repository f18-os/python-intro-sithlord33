Many of my friends helped me in finishing this lab
-Ricardo Alvarez guided me through understanding how the basic shell functions
work. How to fix fork and piping. He guided and provided me with the functions
to split the lists when detecting a pipe.

-Eduardo Lara showed me the basic algorithm of the shell lab

-I worked together with Irving Sanchez on starting and working on the project
